# Big Software 

The idea behind this program is based on the book "Head First Object-Oriented
Analysis and Design: A Brain Friendly Guide to OOA&D", by Brett McLaughlin,
Gary Pollice and David West. My profesor recomended this lecture for us, and
based on this, created a project to be done. He called "The Big Software".

### What is it about?

Rick is a Guitars Shop owner, and this store is specialized to find the 
perfect instruments for his demanding customers. Some months ago, Rick 
decided to change the old paper system to store your guitars and started 
using a computational system. He hired a company to make this tool for 
him, but the company made a dirty coding project.

### What is the project's purpose?

Do a clean and good project to help Rick with his objective of finding
perfect instruments for his customers. This project is separeted in 
5 levels, each one request something different.

### Version 1

Fix the project that the company that Rick hired, to make it works as
Rick needs to work. Basically, it has to find a guitar in inventory
based on rigid demands of customers.

### Version 2

With objects orientation, each object is designed to have a specific 
goal, to execute just its function. In summary, this is not happening with
the code made to Rick's Store. This new version delivers objects that fulfill
just with its finality, with oriented programming concepts.

### Version 3

Now Rick wants to sell guitars with 12 strings. This update needs a structure 
projected to be reusable and that can be maintained, even if has more updates 
to do. Version 3 changes de project to include a new point of view in guitar
specifications.


### Verison 4

Now Rick want to sell a different type of instrument, Mandolins. But everytime
he wants to add a new attribute, like more strings, or new instruments, the 
code has to be totally redone? This version strives to create a trully 
reusable code that won't give headaches when Rick wants to add a new 
instrument in his store. 

### Version 5

The tool projected untill now is flawed. For example, if Mandolin and Guitars
are instruments, and the only difference is the specifications, our project is
not so flexible as much as we thought. This version throws the previous version
away to create a new (and smaller!) project to Rick's store, even if he wants to
sell a guitar, a banjo, a fiddle, a bass, a sax... any instrument.

### Final Notes

All te versions done are documented with clear coments and specific variable
names, to better identify where everything is supposed to be. Virtual 
environments were not used, and the only module imported for contruct this code is enum module.
